Prerequisites
This course uses the Python programming language and assumes that you have some familiarity with basic programming concepts in some procedural programming language (C, C++, Java, Ruby, etc.). We will review python in week 1, and I will explain python programming concepts throughout the semester. 

No specific math capability is required though it will be helpful if you are familiar with the basic concepts of algebra, set theory, and probability.
